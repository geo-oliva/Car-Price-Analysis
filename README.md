This notebook is focused on exploratory analysis of a car dataset. As a beginner in the field, it's meant as a structured, practical application of core data analysis skills. The goal is to better understand how various features affect car pricing, and to identify which cars may be considered overpriced based on statistical comparisons.

The analysis uses Python with libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. It walks through data cleaning, feature exploration, and visualization.
